sr:: () -> put sample rate on the stack
whiteNoise, noise, n:: () -> each sample in each channel is the next value provided by pseudo-random generator

channel:<N>, ch:<N>:: (x) -> compute only channel N of signal and broadcast it to all channels

=== Math

Binary arithmetic operations are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, '^'. If you prefer, you can use aliases `add`, `sub`, `mul`, `div`, `mod`, `pow`.

`\\` is for reciprocal. `16 \\` will produce 1/16th.
